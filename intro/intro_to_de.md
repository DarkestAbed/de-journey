# Introduction to Data Engineering
This brief chapter introduces the journey of a person trying to become a Data Engineer.

We've all seen the meme:
![so much truth](https://img.ifunny.co/images/02d12d6f53294fe0c913e23f4a7977b4cb3fb0666fa832b094eb39a1b6f85422_1.webp)

But why does it become a meme? Why the scientist stands on the shoulders of the engineer to successfully navigate the sometimes turbulent waters of the data lakes? And, most important of all, why would we want to kill the joke by explaining it?

It's important to first define what is a data engineer:
> Data engineers design and implement the management, monitoring, security, and privacy of data using the full stack of data services.<br>

So, breaking down the definition, data engineers:
* **design**: a data engineer has the ability to design and architect a technology solution around data platforms and tools
* **implement**: a data engineer deploys data (and, sometimes, general technological solutions) using software engineering and operations methodologies, like DevOps. It is key to underline the importance of the deployment methods in several different stages (staging, QA, test, production)
* **management**: a data engineer knows, deploys and utilizes management solutions, such as YARN (for Hadoop clusters) and Splunk (for log aggregation on cloud instances)
* **monitoring**: for a data engineer, monitoring solutions are of the outmost importance, because the stability of the deployed solutions is key to the success of the overall system
* **security and privacy**: in the current state of the art, a data engineer needs to be at least acquainted with security and privacy tools and methodologies, so to keep sensitive data outside of the prying eyes of the internet, and secrets be secrets
* **using the full stack of data services**: cloud and local deployments include several different tools and platforms available to a data engineer, so he can accomplish all the described tasks. In these modules, we will take a brief look at some of these tools
